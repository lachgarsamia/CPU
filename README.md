# Process Scheduling Simulator

A Python-based process scheduling simulator supporting multiple scheduling algorithms: 
- FCFS, 
- SJF, 
- Priority Scheduling, 
- Round Robin, 
- Priority + Round Robin.

This repository provides two ways to interact with the simulator:

* **`main.py`**: A terminal-based CLI version.
* **`app.py`**: A Flask-powered web application with a UI for interactive visualization.

## Features

* Simulates common CPU scheduling algorithms:

  * First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
  * Shortest Job First (SJF)
  * Priority Scheduling
  * Round Robin (RR)
  * Priority + Round Robin (Hybrid)
* Gantt chart visualization of process execution
* Support for:
  * Manual process input
  * Random process generation
  * CSV upload (terminal-based only)
  * Session-based state tracking

##  Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MTheCreator/OS-Assign-1-CC
cd OS-Assign-1-CC
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml

conda activate OS-ASSIGN_1
```

---

##  Run the Terminal Version

```bash
python main.py
```

Follow the prompts to choose an algorithm and enter process data via the command line.

---

##  Run the Web App (UI)

```bash
python app.py
```

The app will run on [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080). Open it in your browser to start simulating!

## ðŸ“Š Sample Visual Output

* Gantt charts are automatically generated to represent the execution order of processes.
* Charts are saved/exported for reports or assignments.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

* The web app uses Flask sessions for temporary storage and `Matplotlib` for visualization.
* The scheduler logic is decoupled for reuse in both the CLI and UI.
* This tool is ideal for Operating Systems coursework or scheduling research.

* To test the `main.py` with a `csv` entry, we kept an example of processes in `test_processes.csv`, else you can just run the code and generate / enter manually the processes and then save them in a `csv` for later use. You can also save all outputs (log of scheduling, gant charts, â€¦)

## About:
This project comes in the context of an assignment for the class of Operating Systems @UM6P - College of Computing, where we get our hands on exercise of implementing the most famous scheduling algorithms in order to see first-hand how they work, far from the theory.
